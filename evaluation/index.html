    <h2>Medical Questions</h2>
    <h3>#1: In a past conversation we had, you mentioned your theory of your body being controlled by something else that isn't you, describing it as torture. How does that phenomenon make you feel exactly, and why do you consider it torture?</h3>
    <b>Do you remember saying that?</b>
    <p id="detailed">I think I do, my memory's still not good but it's getting better anyways. It feels weird, and it makes me ponder if I am me or if it is me. I'd say it's similar to watching yourself do things you don't intentionally do. Like opening a fridge to look for food, only to do that same thing a few minutes later. Except instead of it being subconscious you are watching yourself do it without thinking. You are thinking but it's not you doing it.</p>
    <b>Basically the lack of control?</b>
    <p id="detailed">Sort of. You don't know why it happens other than it has to be you doing it or something is deeply wrong.</p>
    <b>And do you sometimes think you might be doing it yourself without thinking or remembering it?</b>
    <p id="detailed">I doubt it's me but I never catch myself doing anything odd other than being somewhere I don't remember.</p>
    <b>You mentioned your memory still not being good, do you forget only about recent things?</b>
    <p id="detailed">I can only remember things when the time is right. Or at least I think so. I don't know how else I would be able to remember the approximate price of specific organs, or how I can recall a whole entire christian prayer.</p>
    <b>What would define the time being right?</b>
    <p id="detailed">I don't know, but when I do something it comes to mind.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>#2: In our last evaluation, you mentioned an encounter with SCP-682. Did that encounter change you in any way? Do you feel fear towards this specific anomaly or have any new thoughts about the occurrence?</h3>
    <p id="detailed">Other than make me acknowledge that weird “effect” I seem to have, no. It hasn't affected me much. No, I don't really feel any fear towards it.</p>
    <b>You'd say that acknowledging this fact hasn't changed your usual behavior?</b>
    <p id="detailed">Yeah, all it did was make me a bit more conscious of things happening around me.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>#3: You also mentioned an encounter with an anomalous invisible being on two occasions. Have you encountered it any other times? Do you have any doubts in your mind about the reality of any of the events you remember, considering the possibility of them being hallucinations caused by other factors?</h3>
    <p id="detailed">Many times, just not in recent times. I mean, if two people who are largely different can observe them. I'm pretty sure they were real.</p>
    <b>Do you think there is any meaning to that sudden stop of appearances?</b>
    <p id="detailed">Possibly but I am more worried about what it may have done.</p>
    <b>What could it have done?</b>
    <p id="detailed">I don't know. It did something to raven which resulted in him becoming essentially quasi-omniscient. And I assume it did something to us too, but I don't know what it did. It doesn't tell people what it does.</p>
    <b>So you are worried something similar might happen again?</b>
    <p id="detailed">I'm worried because I don't know what it did.</p>
    <b>Your logical thinking seems to have no doubt, but do your inner thoughts think the same? I am not doubting you in any way, just want to confirm how you feel about it.</b>
    <p id="detailed">I don't have inner thoughts to my knowledge.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>#4: How have all the anomalous events you've ever faced changed you, in your opinion? Do you fear the possibility of any similar events occurring in the future, or do you find some sort of enjoyment in them?</h3>
    <p id="detailed">I'd say it's only made me more and more curious. I'm not afraid, I sort of anticipate them nowadays.</p>
    <b>Could you elaborate on how you anticipate them?</b>
    <p id="detailed">I know they'll come, I know it'll be terrifying in the moment, and I know I'll come away more curious than before. So I consider everything it could be, and plan ahead.</p>

    <hr>
    <h3>#5: Do you feel like your life has been heading in a positive direction so far, and do you believe the future holds good things for you?</h3>
    <p id="detailed">My future will either be that of a nightmare or that of a decaying star. Depends on whatever that thing chose for me.</p>
    <b>Who are you talking about when you say "that thing"?</b>
    <p id="detailed">The Knight</p>
    <b>You've mentioned the knight on one of the charts, would you mind explaining to me what he/it is exactly?</b>
    <p id="detailed">Certain abomination that uh. It's what caused Director Raven to become what he is.</p>
    <b>Does it have any relation with the anomalous being you mentioned in our previous evaluation?</b>
    <p id="detailed">I think that is what I meant, yes.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Inkblot Charts</h2>
    <h3>#1: </h3>
    <p id="detailed">A grafted human or a Site Alpha experiment. Or what'll happen to me if ScD catches me.</p>
    <b>The patient is referring to a bet she made with the scientific department.</b>
    <h3>#2: </h3>
    <p id="detailed">Fern's food or the Knight's helmet.</p>
    <h3>#3: </h3>
    <p id="detailed">A mask, one usually used to hide the face. That and also an open brain at the top.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <h3>Diagnosis:</h3>
    <p id="detailed">It appears that you tend to associate most unknown phenomena you encounter with the anomalous, as evidenced by the charts I requested you to describe. There seems to be a particular obsession with the being you refer to as "The Knight," even though we are uncertain of its actual existence. I would describe the overall situation as neither good nor bad. Generally, having obsessions like this and constantly fixating on something is not considered a positive sign. I believe that the type of effect it had in your mind could be a bad thing, but not a dangerously bad thing; although it would need to be assessed further. Regarding the answers to the questions, they seem to support the notion that your mind may be fixated on the anomalous, which could be signs of a low level OCD.</p>
    <h3>Treatment:</h3>
    <p id="detailed">For your treatment, I would like to suggest exploring alternative approaches to understanding the occurrences you experience. Try to think of them in different ways and avoid instantly associating them with the anomalous. While it may not be currently possible, once the psychological branch opens up, I will appoint therapy sessions for you.</p>

    <h2>Evaluation Review</h2>
    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p id="detailed">The first question was aimed at partially assessing the strange phenomenon previously reported by the patient, with the objective of determining whether it is genuinely occurring or not. Additionally, one of the additional objectives was to gain an understanding of the patient's thought processes. It appears that the patient has a fear of not being in control of her own life, as evidenced by her reports of memory issues and instances where she finds herself in places without any recollection of how she ended up there. It is difficult to assess the possibility of an anxiety disorder being present in the patient's life due to the weird phenomenon actually occurring.</p>
    <p id="detailed">The second question was posed after examining the charts to clarify my suspicion regarding whether the patient actually only thinks about the anomalous. The patient's answers could indicate either normal behavior (being scared of the event) or something unusual, such as being interested in it and not paying attention to other occurrences. I believe her answers show how she has accepted the anomalous as a normal part of her life, which could be due to the many years of contact she has had with anomalies.</p>
    <p id="detailed">The third question aimed to assess the possibility of the patient experiencing hallucinations or remembering things that didn't actually happen. Based on the answers provided, the patient appears to have no doubt that everything she remembers actually occurred, presenting several logical arguments in support of her claims. The patient appears to be fearful of whatever capabilities this anomalous being possesses. She seems to view it as a malevolent entity, similar to an evil god, that disrupts people's lives. The patient also believes that the anomalous effects she is currently experiencing are somehow connected to this being.</p>
    <p id="detailed">Similar to the second question, the objective of the fourth question was to assess the extent of the patient's involvement and immersion in the anomalous world. It aimed to understand how the patient's current behavior relates to everything that has happened to her in relation to the anomalies.</p>
    <p id="detailed">The last question was a general question intended to learn more about the patient's everyday life. However, the answers provided were also related to the anomalous, which further reinforces the argument that the patient is highly obsessed with the anomalous.</p>
    <p id="detailed">I believe it's important to use all the information gathered in this psychological evaluation for future evaluations or therapy sessions to help the patient with their current mental problems. By considering this information, other Medical Department personnel can better understand the patient's unique situation and adapt their approach to address their specific needs and concerns that came up during the evaluation.</p>
    
    <h3>Charts</h3>
    <p id="detailed">The patient has seen the first chart and has associated it with some kind of aberration, possibly related to Site Alpha. The patient initially associated the second chart with Fern's food, but later also linked it to the helmet of the being she frequently talks about. The patient did not associate the last chart with any anomaly. Instead, they interpreted it as a mask with an open brain positioned on top of it.</p>
    <p id="detailed">These interpretations can be seen as evidence of the patient's brain being disconnected from the ordinary world, as they tend to associate the unknown with abnormal or anomalous phenomena.</p>
